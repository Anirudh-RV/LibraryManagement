PLAN
Day 1 (23rd Sept 2021):

- Set up Environment
- Set up Template for:
- MongoDB
- Go API
- React front end

Day 2 (24th Sept 2021):

- Set up the DB relations
- Use JWT for authorization
- Create custom data entries
- Set up API for CRUD and necessary operations for only:
  a. Member
  b. Book
  c. Issuance
- Can extend to others in: https://dbdiagram.io/d/6148c958825b5b01460afb74 if deadline not reached.

- API Requirement:

1. Generating APIs is usually better than writing them.
2. APIs should have some security mechanism built in to prevent unauthorized calls (API Key etc)
3. API should follow a standard. For e.g. the API endpoint should be something like:
   myapplication.abc.com/<entity name >/<entity id>
4. GET libmgmt.abc.com/book/1 should return the details of book with id = 1
5. API should support standard CRUD Methods (PUT, POST, GET)
6. Delete is not required

Day 3 (25th Sept 2021):

- Complete the API Creation
- Get the UI ready for the ask:
  Build UI for a simple dashboard showing which members have books pending for return on a given day
- Verify the API meets all requirements

Day 4 (26th Sept 2021):

- Enhance GET in Order to get ALL VALUES in entity if no ID is sent.
- Containerize the solutions
- Try to setup
- Try what Swagger can do here: https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation/
